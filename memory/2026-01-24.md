## Critical Fix: GIF Display in Slack

**Problem:** Markdown image syntax `![](url)` doesn't render in Slack messages.

**Solution:** Drop raw GIF URLs directly. Slack auto-unfurls them.

```bash
# Get GIF URL
gifgrep "search term" --max 1 --format url
# Returns: https://media.tenor.com/...

# Just include the URL in response
# Slack handles the unfurling
```

**Do NOT:**
- Use markdown syntax `![](url)`
- Do the 3-step file upload (unless actually needed)
- Add debug messages like "🛠️ Exec:" or "✉️ message: send"

**Pattern for personality:**
1. React with 👀 when starting work (immediate feedback)
2. Use GIFs liberally - drop URL, Slack unfurls
3. React with appropriate emoji for quick responses
4. Keep responses clean - no debug output

This is the way.

## X/Twitter Links Protocol

**CRITICAL: For all X.com and Twitter.com links, use bird CLI**

The correct approach:
```bash
# First source credentials
source ~/.config/bird/credentials

# Then use bird commands
bird thread "URL"      # Get full thread
bird replies "URL"     # Get replies
```

**Key facts:**
- Credentials live at `~/.config/bird/credentials`
- Account: @ArthelperAi  
- Always source credentials first
- No Safari cookies needed - we have auth tokens
- Web fetch tools don't work (X blocks bots)

**What happened:** I forgot to source the credentials file and was trying cookie auth instead. The tokens were there all along.
