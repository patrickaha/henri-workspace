## Channel Factory Allowlist Bug Fixed

**Issue:** Created new channels (#manhattan_project and #cara) via channel factory, but Henri wasn't responding to messages - even with @mentions.

**Root Cause:** Slack config has `groupPolicy: "allowlist"` - Henri only responds in explicitly allowed channels. The channel factory was creating channels but NOT adding them to the config allowlist.

**Fix:** Must run `gateway config.patch` after creating each channel:
```bash
clawdbot gateway config.patch '{
  "channels": {
    "slack": {
      "channels": {
        "CHANNEL_ID": {
          "enabled": true,
          "requireMention": false
        }
      }
    }
  }
}'
```

**Updated:** 
- Channel factory flow doc now includes allowlist step
- Troubleshooting guide updated with correct root cause
- Both affected channels (manhattan_project and cara) now working

**Key Learning:** When Slack has allowlist policy, creating a channel via API is only half the job - must also update the config to allow the bot in that channel.
