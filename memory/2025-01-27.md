## Google Authentication Setup
- Configured gog CLI with patrick@arthelper.ai
- Using file-based keyring backend to bypass keychain issues
- Created ~/.gog_env with authentication environment
- Established architecture: Workspace (arthelper.ai) vs Cloud APIs (artstorefronts.com)

## Key Decisions
- Patrick explicitly chose to use patrick@arthelper.ai for Google Workspace access
- Keeping personal workspace separate from company cloud resources
- File-based auth worked after keychain proved problematic

## Technical Notes
- gog requires `source ~/.gog_env` before each use
- Full config saved to memory/google-auth-config.md
