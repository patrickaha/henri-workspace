# Memory vs Documentation

## Bot Memory (Native Tools)
**Location:** `~/clawd/memory/` + `~/clawd/MEMORY.md`

Let Clawdbot's native memory tools write here:
- Ephemeral recall
- Decision logs  
- Context tracking
- Semantic search corpus

**Do not redirect these to Obsidian.**

---

## Documentation (Knowledge Base)
**Location:** Obsidian vault at `/Users/arthelper/Documents/Master Context Henri/`

Human-readable, git-backed content:
- Channel contexts (`05-channels/`)
- Learnings and patterns (`03-learnings/`)
- Resources and references (`04-resources/`)
- Dashboard and TODOs (`00-dashboard/`)

**Syntax:** Use `obsidian-markdown` skill (wikilinks, callouts, properties)
