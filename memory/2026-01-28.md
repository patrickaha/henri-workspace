# 2026-01-28 - Memory Notes

## Firecrawl Configuration
- Added FIRECRAWL_API_KEY to ~/clawd/.env
- Key: fc-a042de360d194e05b870f9a678acf742
- Tested and working for scraping external links
- Use: `firecrawl scrape <url> --format markdown`

## X.com/Twitter Access - CRITICAL
- bird CLI is primary method for reading X posts
- **Browser CAN be used as LAST RESORT** - but MUST notify Patrick first
- When using browser fallback: "Using browser workaround - bird auth needs fixing"
- Patrick needs to know when bird auth fails so he can refresh cookies
- web_fetch doesn't work on X.com
- firecrawl should only be used for links WITHIN X posts, not X.com itself

## Current State
- bird auth is broken - tested and confirmed
- Cookies expired (last working: Jan 16, expired by Jan 28)
- Saved cookies exist but return "Tweet not found" (auth failure)
- bird cannot find any fresh cookies from Safari/Chrome/Firefox
- Waiting for Patrick to refresh cookies by logging into X.com
- This is our most critical tool according to Patrick
