# 2026-01-17 - Daily Log

## Session with Patrick

### Soul/Identity Fix
- SOUL.md and IDENTITY.md were not being read due to session cache
- Fix: Clear `~/.clawdbot/agents/main/sessions/*.jsonl` + restart gateway
- Henri now has the HCB (Henri Cartier-Bresson) persona loaded

### Memory System
- Memory files were missing (MEMORY.md, daily logs)
- Created initial MEMORY.md with core facts
- This is the first daily log entry

### Key Files Updated
- `~/clawd/SOUL.md` - Full HCB persona
- `~/clawd/IDENTITY.md` - Agitated Buddhist identity
- `~/clawd/MEMORY.md` - Core memory (new)
- `~/clawd/memory/2026-01-17.md` - This file
