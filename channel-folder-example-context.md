# Example: Context Files Within Folders

You can add `CONTEXT.md` files inside folders to explain their purpose:

## research/CONTEXT.md
```markdown
# Research Folder

This folder contains background research, market analysis, and competitive intelligence for this channel.

## Organization
- Numbered files (01-, 02-) indicate reading order
- Company analyses use format: `{company-name}-analysis.md`
- Market research: `market-{topic}-{date}.md`

## Key Documents
- `01-market-overview.md` - Start here
- `competitor-matrix.md` - Comparison table
```

## assets/CONTEXT.md
```markdown
# Assets Folder

Media files, screenshots, and visual resources.

## Naming Convention
- Screenshots: `screenshot-{feature}-{date}.png`
- Logos: `logo-{company}-{size}.png`
- Charts: `chart-{metric}-{period}.png`

## Subfolders
- `screenshots/` - UI captures
- `logos/` - Company/product logos
- `charts/` - Generated visualizations
```

## This Gives You:
1. Self-documenting folders
2. Clear organization rules
3. Easy onboarding for anyone new to the channel
4. Consistent patterns across all channels
