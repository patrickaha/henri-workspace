@anyhowdotcom I can afford a Mac Mini with it. But spend wat more to support upstream dependencies. Defo not even close to profitable, lol

**Insight:** Revenues from personal projects are often minimal and fully reinvested into supporting upstream dependencies, underscoring the altruistic, ecosystem-focused reality of indie/open-source work over personal profitability.

@Javarya_Kamran @GergelyOrosz I got a lot of vibed security slop or constructed issues. Some even asked for a bounty.
Then again some are amazing and even send a PR, clear outliers tho.

Overall the system’s broken tho. Sending and kinda forcing/shaming me into replying for a product that is (in parts) not

**Insight:** The vulnerability reporting system is fundamentally flawed, flooded with low-quality or opportunistic submissions demanding bounties, while truly valuable contributions like PRs are rare exceptions, forcing creators to engage with incomplete products.
