KEY INSIGHTS FROM PETER'S PATTERNS:
- CLI-first approach for everything
- 5-10 parallel agents running simultaneously  
- "Close the loop" - agents must verify their own work
- Weave code, don't merge
- Prompts are first-class artifacts
- Ship 600 commits/day using parallel execution

The peter-tweets system is ready to harvest this wisdom daily once you run:
- python harvest-with-replies.py (full report)
- python peter-quick-harvest.py (with Grok analysis)
- Or the shell script: ./manual-api-call.sh

All scripts are in ~/clawd/peter-tweets/
