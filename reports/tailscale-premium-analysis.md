# Tailscale Premium Analysis - January 28, 2026

## Current Usage

### Active Features We Use:
1. **SSH Access** ✅ - CRITICAL
   - Repoprompt SSH: `shanahanland@100.67.25.22`
   - Remote access to Mac Mini
   - This is a premium feature

2. **Funnel** ✅ - Active
   - Running on: https://arthelper.tailfa6630.ts.net
   - Exposes services externally

3. **Multiple Devices** ✅
   - arthelper (this machine)
   - patricks-mac-mini

### Premium Features We Need:

| Feature | Using? | Why Important |
|---------|--------|---------------|
| **SSH** | YES | Repoprompt access, remote work |
| **Serve** | Maybe | Expose local services |
| **Funnel** | YES | External access to services |
| **User sync** | Maybe | Team collaboration |
| **ACLs** | Important | Security controls |

## Recommendation: YES, Get Premium

### Reasons:
1. **SSH is critical** - We actively use it for Repoprompt
2. **Security** - ACLs and user management for team
3. **Future growth** - Serve/Funnel for exposing AI services
4. **Price** - Usually ~$5-10/user/month, minimal for the value

### Free Alternative Impacts:
- ❌ Lose SSH access (breaks Repoprompt)
- ❌ Lose Funnel (no external access)
- ❌ Limited to 3 users
- ❌ No ACL controls

## Action: Use TRIALEXTENSION26 

Extend trial by a month to evaluate, but we'll likely need premium for SSH alone.
