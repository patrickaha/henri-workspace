# Tailscale: Starter vs Premium for Art Storefronts

## Quick Answer: **Starter is Enough** ✅

### Key Differences:

| Feature | Starter | Premium | Do We Need? |
|---------|---------|---------|-------------|
| **SSH** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Required |
| **Funnel** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Using now |
| **Serve** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Using now |
| **Users** | Unlimited | Unlimited | Good |
| **Devices** | 100 + 10/user | 100 + 20/user | Starter is plenty |
| **ACLs** | ✅ YES | ✅ YES | Good for security |
| **SCIM/OIDC** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES | Not needed |
| **Log streaming** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES | Not needed |
| **Device approval** | ❌ NO | ✅ YES | Not critical |

### Premium-Only Features You DON'T Need:
- SCIM provisioning (enterprise user sync)
- OIDC authentication (enterprise SSO)
- Log streaming to SIEM
- Device approval workflows
- Advanced compliance features

### What You Get with Starter:
- ✅ **SSH access** (Repoprompt works!)
- ✅ **Funnel** (external access)
- ✅ **Serve** (expose services)
- ✅ **ACLs** (security policies)
- ✅ **100+ devices** (way more than needed)
- ✅ **Unlimited users**

## Recommendation: Go with Starter

**Pricing (typical):**
- Starter: ~$5/user/month
- Premium: ~$10/user/month

You'd be paying double for features you won't use. Starter has everything you need for Repoprompt, Funnel, and team collaboration.

## Action Plan:
1. Use `TRIALEXTENSION26` for 1-month extension
2. Upgrade to **Starter** before trial ends
3. Save 50% vs Premium
