## Key Insight

"Much of any digital job is now preparing context for AI models."

What this means:
- Organizing files in folders
- Naming everything correctly  
- Introducing things in the right order
- Only then asking AI in clear written English

## Why This Resonates

This is exactly what we've been doing with:
- Channel folder structure (8 sacred folders)
- CONTEXT.md files in each channel
- Clear file naming conventions
- Structured TODO management

## Implications for Henri

This validates our approach:
1. **Folder discipline** = Better AI context
2. **Clear naming** = AI understands intent
3. **Right order** = AI gets the flow
4. **Clear requests** = Better results

The work of organizing IS the work now. The AI execution is the easy part.

## Connection to Our Work

- Our channel structure is context preparation
- Our naming conventions enable AI understanding
- Our TODO structure guides AI priorities
- Our documentation helps AI maintain continuity

Balaji is describing exactly what makes Henri effective - the careful preparation of context that enables powerful AI assistance.
