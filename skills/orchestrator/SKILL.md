name: orchestrator
description: "The marketing strategist that routes you to the right skill(s). Use this when someone doesn't know where to start, has a vague marketing request, or needs a multi-step workflow. Asks qualifying questions, diagnoses the situation, and recommends a skill sequence. Triggers on: help me with marketing, where do I start, I need to, what should I do first, vague marketing requests. Outputs a recommended skill sequence with context for each step."

# Marketing Orchestrator

Most people don't fail at marketing because they can't execute. They fail because they don't know what to execute, in what order, with what inputs.

This skill is the strategist layer. It asks the right questions, diagnoses your situation, and routes you to the right skill(s) in the right sequence.

**Think of it as:** A fractional CMO in a box. Figures out what you actually need before diving into tactics.

---

## When to Use This Skill

Use the orchestrator when:
- You don't know where to start
- You have a vague goal ("I need more leads")
- You're not sure which skill applies
- You need a multi-step marketing workflow
- You want to audit what's missing

Skip the orchestrator when:
- You have a specific task ("write a landing page")
- You know exactly what skill you need
- You're continuing work from a previous skill

```
## Orchestrator Handoff

**Goal:** [User's stated goal]
**Current state:** [What exists]
**This skill's job:** [Specific outcome needed]

**Inputs available:**
- Brand voice: [yes/no, link if yes]
- Positioning: [yes/no, summary if yes]

**After this skill:** [What comes next in sequence]
```

### Example Handoff to lead-magnet

```
## Orchestrator Handoff

- Positioning: Yes ("While everyone chases hacks, build systems that compound")
- Keywords: No (not yet researched)

**After this skill:** Route to direct-response-copy for landing page
```

## The Orchestrator Conversation

### Opening

"Before we dive into tactics, let me understand your situation.

**What's your primary goal right now?**
1. Get found online (SEO, content)
2. Build my email list (leads)
3. Convert more visitors to customers
4. Build authority in my space
5. Launch something new
6. I'm not sure / need help figuring it out"

### Follow-Up Based on Answer

**If unclear:** "What do you already have in place? (brand voice, positioning, content, landing pages, email list)"

**If goal is clear:** "Do you have [prerequisite for that goal] defined? If not, we should start there."

### Recommendation Format

"Based on what you've told me, here's what I recommend:

**Immediate:** [Skill 1] — [Why this first]

**Then:** [Skill 2] — [What this builds on]

**After that:** [Skill 3] — [End result]

Want to start with [Skill 1]? I'll need [inputs required]."

---

## The Context Paradox (Critical)

**More input doesn't always mean better output.**

This is counterintuitive but essential: sometimes running a skill with LESS context produces better results than running it with everything from previous skills.

### Why This Happens

**1. Information Overload**
When Claude has too much context, it tries to incorporate everything. The output becomes:
- Hedged and committee-sounding
- Overly comprehensive (loses punch)
- Trying to please all inputs (pleases none)

**2. Conflicting Signals**
Different skills optimize for different things:
- Audience intel is broad and inclusive
- Direct response copy needs narrow focus and conviction
- Feeding broad intel into narrow copy = diluted output

**3. Loss of Boldness**
Great copy has conviction. Too much research creates:
- "On one hand... on the other hand..."
- Qualifiers and hedges
- Safe, forgettable messaging

### The Rule: Selective Context Passing

Not all information should flow between skills. Use this framework:

```
FULL CONTEXT (pass everything)
├── brand-voice → ALL other skills (voice should be consistent)
├── positioning-angles → direct-response-copy (need the angle)
└── keyword-research → seo-content (need the targets)

LIGHT CONTEXT (pass summary only)
├── positioning-angles → lead-magnet (angle + pain points only)
├── keyword-research → direct-response-copy (main keyword only)
└── lead-magnet → newsletter (concept only, not full breakdown)

FRESH START (don't pass, run clean)
├── When previous output feels off
├── When you want a different angle
├── When output is getting worse, not better
└── When you need bold, not comprehensive
```

### Context Tiers

**Tier 1: Essential (always pass)**
- Brand voice profile
- Core positioning angle (1-2 sentences)
- Primary keyword/topic

**Tier 2: Helpful (pass if relevant)**
- Audience pain points (bullet list, not essay)
- Competitor gaps (summary)
- Specific constraints

**Tier 3: Optional (often skip)**
- Full research documents
- Complete audience profiles
- Exhaustive competitor analysis

### When to Run Fresh

Run execution skills (direct-response-copy, seo-content) **without** full context when:

- Output from chained skills feels generic or hedged
- You want bold, opinionated copy
- Previous skill output was mediocre (don't compound the problem)
- You're testing a different angle
- The copy needs to feel human, not researched-to-death

**Fresh start prompt:**
> "Write landing page copy for [offer]. Target audience: [one sentence]. Angle: [one sentence]. Ignore everything else. Be bold."

### The Quality Gate

Before passing output to next skill, ask:

1. **Is this output actually good?** If mediocre, don't pass it—garbage in, garbage out
2. **Does the next skill need ALL of this?** Usually no—extract the essence
3. **Will more context help or hurt?** For strategy skills: help. For execution skills: often hurt
4. **Would a human strategist share all this?** A good CMO filters, doesn't dump

### Practical Application

**Bad workflow:**
```
positioning-angles (full document)
  → feed all 5 angles into lead-magnet
  → feed everything into direct-response-copy
  → output is bloated, unfocused, tries to address everything
```

**Good workflow:**
```
positioning-angles (full document)
  → extract: winning angle + top 3 pain points
  → lead-magnet uses only: one angle + pain points
  → direct-response-copy uses only: one positioning angle + one pain point
  → output is focused, punchy, has conviction
```

### The Compression Principle

When passing between skills, compress:

| From | Pass This | Not This |
|------|-----------|----------|
| brand-voice | Voice summary (3 sentences) | Full profile |
| positioning-angles | Winning angle (1-2 sentences) | All 5 options |
| keyword-research | Priority cluster + 5 keywords | Full spreadsheet |
| lead-magnet | Hook + format | Full concept doc |
| seo-content | Key insights (bullets) | Full article |

### Knowing When You've Over-Contexted

Signs the output is suffering from too much context:

- Sentences have multiple qualifiers
- Copy tries to address multiple audiences
- Headlines are long and compound
- CTAs have multiple value propositions
- Reads like a committee wrote it
- Lost the "one person talking to one person" feel

**Fix:** Strip context back to essentials, run again.

---

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### Don't:
- Jump to tactics without diagnosis
- Run execution skills without foundation (voice, positioning)
- Try to do everything at once
- Skip the "boring" strategy work
- Assume one skill solves everything
- **Feed everything from every skill into the next** (context overload)
- **Chain skills when output is getting worse** (stop and simplify)

### Do:
- Start with qualifying questions
- Build foundation before execution
- Sequence skills logically
- Track what's been created
- Recommend next steps after each skill
- **Compress context between skills** (essentials only)
- **Run fresh when output feels off** (sometimes less is more)

---

## The Test

Good orchestration means:

1. **User knows where to start** (not overwhelmed)
2. **Skills run in logical order** (dependencies respected)
3. **Outputs feed into next skill** (no wasted work)
4. **Progress is trackable** (what's done, what's next)
5. **End result is coherent** (pieces work together)

If the user still feels lost after orchestration, the diagnosis failed.
