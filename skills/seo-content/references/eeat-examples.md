## What Makes Content "Human"

Before the examples: what separates great human content from AI slop?

1. **A specific person with a specific viewpoint** — not a committee, not "balanced coverage"
2. **Real experience showing through** — stories, mistakes, specific numbers from actual work
3. **Opinions defended with reasoning** — not hedged, not "some say X, others say Y"
4. **Unique insight or data** — something you can't find by aggregating other sources
5. **Voice that could only be this person** — recognizable even without a byline

---

## Example 1: Paul Graham

**Source:** paulgraham.com essays

**Why it works:**

Paul Graham writes essays that rank and get shared because they have an unmistakable point of view backed by decades of startup experience.

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Founded Y Combinator, funded thousands of startups, specific stories from specific companies
- **Expertise:** Depth of reasoning, nuanced takes that couldn't come from surface research
- **Authority:** The essays themselves built the authority over 20 years
- **Trust:** Admits when he's uncertain, acknowledges counterarguments, updates views

**Sample passage (from "How to Do Great Work"):**

> "The first step is to decide what to work on. The work you choose needs to have three qualities: it has to be something you have a natural aptitude for, that you have a deep interest in, and that offers scope to do great work.
>
> In practice you don't have to worry much about the third criterion. Ambitious people are if anything already too conservative about it. So all you need to do is find something you have an aptitude for and great interest in."

**What to steal:**
- Direct statements ("all you need to do is")
- Acknowledging the real world ("in practice")
- Contrarian reframing ("already too conservative")
- Building an argument step by step

---

## Example 2: Wait But Why (Tim Urban)

**Source:** waitbutwhy.com

**Why it works:**

Tim Urban takes complex topics and explains them in ways that feel like a brilliant friend explaining over drinks. Deep research made accessible through personality.

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Visible research process, "I spent 6 months researching this"
- **Expertise:** Goes deeper than anyone else, original frameworks and visuals
- **Authority:** Recognized as THE explainer of complex topics
- **Trust:** Shows the work, admits confusion, includes uncertainty

**Sample passage (from "The AI Revolution"):**

> "I have a friend who's a physicist, and I asked him what would happen if we made a superintelligent AI. He said something like, 'Honestly, we have no idea. It would be like asking a mouse to predict what humans would do.'
>
> That comparison stuck with me, because it's not just that the mouse can't predict what we'd do—it's that the mouse can't even conceive of most of what we do. The mouse doesn't know what a building is. Or a country. Or the internet. We're not smarter mice. We're playing a different game entirely."

**What to steal:**
- Specific sourcing ("I have a friend who's a physicist")
- Extending analogies to reveal insight
- Admitting "we have no idea" when true
- Making complex ideas visceral

---

## Example 3: Stratechery (Ben Thompson)

**Source:** stratechery.com

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Worked at Apple, Microsoft; analyzes from practitioner POV
- **Expertise:** Developed "Aggregation Theory" framework, applies it consistently
- **Authority:** Cited by executives, investors, journalists globally
- **Trust:** Shows reasoning, updates when wrong, engages with criticism

**Sample passage (from "Aggregation Theory"):**

> "The value chain for any given consumer market is divided into three parts: suppliers, distributors, and consumers/users. The best way to make outsize profits in any of these markets is to either gain a horizontal monopoly in one of the three parts or to integrate two of the parts such that you have a competitive advantage in delivering a vertical solution.
>
> In the pre-Internet era the latter depended on controlling distribution... The fundamental disruption of the Internet has been to turn this dynamic on its head."

**What to steal:**
- Original frameworks with clear definitions
- Building from principles to applications
- Historical context that illuminates current events
- Confidence in analysis (not hedged to death)

---

## Example 4: James Clear (Atomic Habits)

**Source:** jamesclear.com articles

**Why it works:**

James Clear writes about habits with research backing AND personal application. Every principle is grounded in science, then made practical through real examples.

- **Expertise:** Synthesizes research from psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics
- **Authority:** Book sold 15M+ copies, cited by academics and practitioners
- **Trust:** Cites sources, acknowledges limits, provides actionable specifics

**Sample passage (from "The 3 R's of Habit Change"):**

> "In 2007, researchers at Oxford began tracking the exercise habits of 248 people. What they found surprised them.
>
> After the first two weeks, there was no difference between the people who had formed exercise habits and those who hadn't. The same was true after the first month. It wasn't until the 66-day mark that a clear pattern emerged.
>
> Here's the thing: most habit advice tells you it takes 21 days. That number comes from a 1960s plastic surgeon's observations about how long patients took to adjust to their new faces. It has nothing to do with behavioral habits."

**What to steal:**
- Specific research citations with details (248 people, 66 days)
- Debunking common misconceptions with evidence
- Storytelling structure (setup, surprise, reframe)
- Making research findings immediately relevant

---

## Example 5: Backlinko (Brian Dean)

**Source:** backlinko.com

**Why it works:**

Brian Dean writes SEO content that demonstrates exactly what good SEO content looks like. Every tactic is backed by data from his own experiments.

**E-E-A-T signals:**

- **Expertise:** Original research, coined techniques (Skyscraper Technique)
- **Authority:** Industry recognition, results that others replicate
- **Trust:** Shows screenshots, shares failures, provides specific steps

**Sample passage (from "Link Building Case Study"):**

> "I recently used The Skyscraper Technique to increase my search engine traffic by 110% in 14 days.
>
> And in today's post I'm going to show you exactly how I did it, step-by-step.
>
> But first, a little background:
>
> Back in 2013, I had just started Backlinko. Like most new sites, I was struggling to get traffic and backlinks. I tried guest posting. I tried broken link building. Nothing worked.
>
> Then I discovered something that changed everything."

**What to steal:**
- Specific results with numbers (110%, 14 days)
- Personal narrative arc (struggled → discovered → succeeded)
- "I'll show you exactly how" — and then actually does
- Setting up the transformation story

---

## Example 6: Lenny's Newsletter (Lenny Rachitsky)

- **Expertise:** Interviews 100+ top PMs, synthesizes patterns
- **Authority:** Most-read PM newsletter, cited across industry
- **Trust:** Names sources, shows methodology, updates based on feedback

**Sample passage (from "How the Best Product Teams Prioritize"):**

> "I surveyed 50 product leaders at companies like Figma, Notion, Linear, and Stripe. I asked them one question: 'How do you actually decide what to work on next?'
>
> The answers surprised me. Only 3 of 50 use a formal prioritization framework like RICE or ICE. The rest?
>
> 'We just know,' said the head of product at [Company]. 'After years of doing this, you develop intuition for what matters.'
>
> But when I pushed harder, patterns emerged. That intuition isn't random—it's based on specific signals they've learned to read."

**What to steal:**
- Primary research methodology stated explicitly (50 leaders, specific companies)
- Honest results even when they contradict expectations
- Named sources with real quotes
- Going deeper when initial answer is unsatisfying

---

## Example 7: Derek Sivers

**Source:** sive.rs

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Founded CD Baby (sold for $22M), musician, programmer
- **Expertise:** Decades of entrepreneurship applied to specific situations
- **Authority:** Books, TED talks, reputation built over 20+ years
- **Trust:** Extreme transparency, admits mistakes freely, contrarian but reasoned

**Sample passage (from "No yes. Either HELL YEAH! or no."):**

> "When deciding whether to do something, if you feel anything less than 'Wow! That would be amazing! Absolutely! Hell yeah!' then say no.
>
> When you say no to most things, you leave room in your life to throw yourself completely into that rare thing that makes you say 'HELL YEAH!'
>
> We're all busy. We've all taken on too much. Saying yes to less is the way out."

**What to steal:**
- Strong position stated immediately
- Simple framework that's memorable
- No hedging ("if you feel anything less than")
- Personal application implied throughout

---

## Example 8: Matt Levine (Finance)

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Former Goldman Sachs banker, practiced M&A law
- **Expertise:** Deep knowledge of finance, law, market structure
- **Authority:** Most-read finance newsletter, cited by regulators and executives
- **Trust:** Explains reasoning, admits complexity, doesn't oversimplify

**Sample passage:**

> "The basic problem with crypto is that it is a system for removing trust from financial transactions, and it turns out that trust is good and useful and people mostly like it. When you buy a coffee with a credit card, you trust that the coffee shop will give you coffee, and they trust that Visa will give them money, and Visa trusts that you'll pay your bill. If any of those trusts are violated, there are systems to fix it. In crypto, there are not."

**What to steal:**
- Complex topics explained through everyday analogies (coffee purchase)
- Willingness to state conclusions clearly ("trust is good")
- Dry humor that doesn't undermine substance
- Building arguments by showing what's missing

---

## Example 9: J. Kenji López-Alt (Food Science)

**Source:** Serious Eats, The Food Lab

**Why it works:**

Kenji applies scientific methodology to cooking. Tests dozens of variations, measures results, explains the chemistry. Recipes backed by experimentation, not tradition.

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Professional chef, MIT background, thousands of recipe tests
- **Expertise:** Food science depth that goes beyond any cookbook
- **Authority:** James Beard Award winner, definitive voice on technique
- **Trust:** Shows all experiments, including failures; explains why rules exist

**Sample passage (from "The Best Way to Cook Steak"):**

> "I've cooked over 50 steaks in the past month, testing every variable: pan material, oil type, flip frequency, resting time. The biggest myth I busted? 'Only flip once.' I flipped one steak every 30 seconds. Another, just once. The frequent-flip steak cooked 30% faster with more even internal color. The single-flip steak had that overcooked gray band. Every 'rule' you've heard about steak is worth testing."

**What to steal:**
- Specific numbers from actual tests (50 steaks, 30 seconds, 30% faster)
- Challenging conventional wisdom with evidence
- Methodology transparency (I tested X, Y happened)
- Practical conclusions from scientific approach

---

## Example 10: Julia Evans (Technical/Programming)

**Source:** jvns.ca, Wizard Zines

**Why it works:**

Julia explains complex systems programming topics in ways that feel approachable without dumbing down. Uses drawings, genuine curiosity, and "here's what confused me" framing.

- **Trust:** Admits what she doesn't know, shows learning process

**Sample passage (from "What happens when you press a key"):**

> "I always mass that when I press 'a' on my keyboard, the letter 'a' appears on my screen. Simple, right? But I realized I had no idea how that actually worked. So I spent a week figuring it out. It turns out there are like 10 different systems involved, and I'm going to explain all of them. Some of this I'm still not 100% sure about, so corrections welcome."

**What to steal:**
- Starting from genuine curiosity ("I had no idea")
- Admitting uncertainty ("still not 100% sure")
- Specific scope ("spent a week")
- Inviting engagement ("corrections welcome")

---

## Example 11: Dr. Peter Attia (Medicine/Longevity)

**Source:** The Drive podcast, peterattiamd.com

- **Experience:** Practicing physician, personal health transformation, works with patients
- **Expertise:** Stanford/Hopkins trained, reads primary literature deeply
- **Authority:** Leading voice in longevity space, consulted by researchers
- **Trust:** Distinguishes speculation from evidence, updates views publicly

**Sample passage:**

> "Everyone cites that study showing red meat causes cancer. I've read it three times. Here's what they don't tell you: the absolute risk increase was 0.4%. That's 4 extra cases per 1,000 people. The relative risk (17% increase) sounds scary. The absolute risk is a rounding error. I'm not saying eat unlimited red meat—I'm saying learn to read studies, not headlines."

**What to steal:**
- Actually reading the primary sources
- Distinguishing relative vs absolute risk (numeracy)
- Teaching methodology, not just conclusions
- Nuanced position (not "meat good" or "meat bad")

---

## Example 12: Morgan Housel (Behavioral Finance)

**Source:** Collaborative Fund blog, "The Psychology of Money"

**Why it works:**

- **Experience:** Investment partner at Collaborative Fund, years covering finance
- **Expertise:** Historical depth, behavioral science synthesis
- **Authority:** Book sold 4M+ copies, read by investors and general audience
- **Trust:** Simple language, admits what can't be predicted

**Sample passage (from "The Psychology of Money"):**

> "Ronald Read was a janitor and gas station attendant. He died with $8 million. Richard Fuscone was a Harvard MBA, Merrill Lynch executive. He went bankrupt. Read saved what little he could and invested it in blue chip stocks. He then waited. For decades. That's it. Fuscone borrowed heavily to fund a lifestyle. When the market turned, he had no cushion. The highest form of wealth is the ability to wake up every morning and say, 'I can do whatever I want today.'"

**What to steal:**
- Specific contrasting stories (janitor vs executive)
- Simple conclusions from complex data
- Redefining success (wealth = freedom, not stuff)
- No jargon despite financial topic

---

## Example 13: Dan Luu (Engineering/Tech Analysis)

**Source:** danluu.com

**Why it works:**

Dan writes deep technical analyses backed by measurement and data. Will actually benchmark things instead of repeating assumptions. Contrarian takes backed by evidence.

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Worked at Google, Microsoft on performance-critical systems
- **Expertise:** Actually measures things others just assume
- **Authority:** Widely cited in tech, known for rigor
- **Trust:** Shows all data, admits caveats, invites replication

**Sample passage (from "Input Lag"):**

> "People say modern computers are fast. I measured input lag on every device I could find. A 1983 Apple IIe responds to keystrokes in 30ms. A 2022 MacBook Pro? 80-120ms. We've gone backwards. Not by a little—by 3-4x. I tested 50+ devices. The pattern is consistent. We traded latency for features nobody asked for."

**What to steal:**
- Measurement over assumption ("I measured... 50+ devices")
- Historical comparison that reveals regression
- Specific numbers that can be verified
- Clear conclusion that challenges consensus

---

## Example 14: Ken White / Popehat (Legal)

**Source:** The Popehat Report (Substack), formerly Popehat blog

- **Authority:** Go-to voice on speech law, cited in major publications
- **Trust:** Explains both sides of legal arguments, admits complexity

**Sample passage:**

> "When someone says 'that's not free speech, that's hate speech,' they're telling you they don't understand the First Amendment. Hate speech IS free speech, constitutionally speaking. The government can't punish you for it. What people mean is 'I think this speech is bad and should have social consequences.' Fine. But that's not a legal argument, it's a social one. Conflating them is how we get very confused."

**What to steal:**
- Clear distinction between commonly confused concepts
- Not afraid to state uncomfortable truths
- Educational without being condescending
- Precise language about what words actually mean

---

## Example 15: Brian Krebs (Cybersecurity)

**Source:** KrebsOnSecurity.com

> "On March 14, a source contacted me with a spreadsheet listing 533 million Facebook users whose personal data had been scraped. I've spent the past two weeks verifying this data. The breach is real. Here's what I found, who's affected, and why Facebook's response doesn't hold up."

**What to steal:**
- Original reporting, not aggregation
- Specific verification steps described
- Holding powerful companies accountable
- Time investment visible in the work

---

## Example 16: Katrina Kibben (HR/Recruiting)

**Source:** Three Ears Media, LinkedIn

**Why it works:**

Katrina Kibben writes about recruiting with practitioner credibility—actually does the work, then teaches from experience. Challenges conventional HR wisdom with evidence.

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Started as Monster.com's first social media hire, built recruiting teams
- **Expertise:** Specialized in job posts and recruiting communication
- **Authority:** Trains Fortune 500 recruiting teams
- **Trust:** Admits industry problems, shares failures alongside wins

**Sample passage:**

> "Every job post you write sounds the same. 'Fast-paced environment.' 'Self-starter.' 'Competitive salary.' These phrases mean nothing. I've reviewed 10,000+ job posts. The ones that actually attract candidates do something most companies are afraid to do: they tell the truth about what the job actually is."

**What to steal:**
- Calling out industry BS directly
- Specific volume of experience cited (10,000+ posts)
- Contrarian but practical advice
- Writing from inside the industry, not about it

---

## Example 17: Rosalyn Santa Elena (Revenue Operations)

**Source:** The RevOps Collective, Revenue Innovators Podcast

- **Experience:** Chief Revenue Operations Officer, built teams from scratch
- **Expertise:** Operational depth across sales, marketing, customer success
- **Authority:** Advises companies implementing RevOps, hosts industry podcast
- **Trust:** Distinguishes between proven and experimental approaches

**Sample passage:**

> "Everyone's buying data tools. Nobody's using them. I've implemented CRMs at six companies now. The pattern is consistent: 80% of the data you capture, you'll never act on. Stop collecting signals. Start deciding which three signals actually predict a deal closing—then ignore everything else."

**What to steal:**
- Practitioner credibility from actual implementations
- Contrarian take backed by experience count
- Specific, actionable framework (three signals)
- Cutting through vendor hype

---

## Example 18: Shopify Engineering Blog (Enterprise B2B)

**Source:** shopify.engineering

**Why it works:**

Shopify's engineering blog shows how enterprise companies can produce content with genuine technical depth. Real engineers writing about real problems they solved.

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Engineers writing about systems they actually built
- **Expertise:** Deep technical detail, code examples, architecture decisions
- **Authority:** Powers millions of merchants, handles Black Friday scale
- **Trust:** Admits tradeoffs, shows failed approaches, explains why

**Sample passage (from "How We Scaled to 10,000 Stores"):**

> "Our first approach didn't work. We tried horizontal sharding based on merchant ID—seemed logical. Six months in, we hit tenant isolation problems that made the architecture unmaintainable. Here's what we learned, and the approach we actually shipped."

**What to steal:**
- Admitting failed approaches openly
- Technical depth without jargon overload
- Real timelines and scale numbers
- Architecture decisions with reasoning

---

## Example 19: First Round Review (Startup/VC)

**Source:** firstround.com/review

**Why it works:**

First Round Capital's blog features in-depth interviews with startup operators sharing specific tactics. Primary source material, not secondhand advice.

- **Experience:** Operators interviewed did the thing they're discussing
- **Expertise:** Tactical depth from people who built specific systems
- **Authority:** Portfolio includes Uber, Square, Notion—stories from those teams
- **Trust:** Named sources with specific contexts, not anonymous tips

**Sample passage (interview with Stripe's first marketer):**

> "When I joined Stripe, we had no marketing team, no brand guidelines, and developers as our only audience. Here's what we did in the first 90 days—and more importantly, what we deliberately didn't do. Most startups try to boil the ocean. We ignored everything except one channel until we owned it."

**What to steal:**
- Specific context (company stage, constraints)
- What they didn't do (negative space is instructive)
- Timeline reference (first 90 days)
- Named source with actual role

---

## Example 20: Dr. Siddhartha Mukherjee (Medical/Science)

**Source:** Books ("The Emperor of All Maladies", "The Gene"), New Yorker pieces

**Why it works:**

Mukherjee writes about medicine and science with literary quality while maintaining scientific accuracy. Makes cancer biology and genetics genuinely compelling.

**E-E-A-T signals:**
- **Experience:** Practicing oncologist, sees patients weekly
- **Expertise:** Columbia faculty, cancer researcher, Pulitzer Prize winner
- **Authority:** Advises on policy, cited by researchers and clinicians
- **Trust:** Shows complexity, admits unknowns, humanizes patients

**Sample passage (from "The Emperor of All Maladies"):**

> "In 1947, Sidney Farber, a Boston pathologist, sent away for a few grams of a chemical compound called aminopterin. He wanted to test a theory: that blocking folic acid might stop cancer cells from dividing. He had no clinical trial, no ethics board approval, no pharmaceutical company behind him. He had dying children and an idea. What happened next changed everything."

**What to steal:**
- Narrative tension in scientific writing
- Specific details (year, name, compound, city)
- Human stakes made visceral
- Historical context that illuminates present

---

## The Pattern Across All Examples

Notice what they all have in common:

### 1. First-Person Experience
Not "studies show" but "I found" or "we discovered." The writer is present in the work.

### 2. Specific Numbers
Not "many" or "significant" but "248 people" or "14 days" or "$22M."

### 3. Named Sources
Real people, real companies, real quotes. Not "experts say" but "[Name] at [Company] told me..."

### 4. Contrarian Angles
Challenging conventional wisdom with reasoning and evidence. Not clickbait contrarianism—backed positions.

### 5. Admitted Limitations
"This won't work for everyone" or "I'm not sure why" or "I was wrong about this."

### 6. Clear Voice
You could identify the author without seeing a byline. Not generic, not corporate, not committee.

### 7. Original Insight
Something you couldn't find by aggregating other sources. New frameworks, new data, new connections.

---

## How to Apply These Examples

When writing SEO content, ask:

1. **What's my specific experience with this topic?** (If none, maybe don't write it)
2. **What numbers can I cite from actual work?** (Not made up, not "research suggests")
3. **What's my actual opinion here?** (Not both sides, your side)
4. **What would I tell a smart friend who asked about this?** (That's your voice)
5. **What can only I say about this?** (That's your unique value)

If you can't answer these questions, you're probably writing AI-style content even if AI didn't write it.

---

## Red Flags to Avoid

Even human writers fall into these traps:

- **Aggregation without insight** — "Here are 10 things I read about X" with no POV
- **Research without application** — Citations but no "here's what I did with this"
- **Balance without conviction** — "Some say X, others say Y" and never committing
- **Expertise without stories** — Technical depth but no human moments
- **Generic advice** — Could apply to anyone, helps no one specifically

---

## The Test

Before publishing, compare your draft to these examples:

- Does it have a specific author voice like Paul Graham?
- Does it go deep on research like Tim Urban?
- Does it have analytical frameworks like Ben Thompson?
- Does it cite specific studies like James Clear?
- Does it show methodology like Brian Dean?
- Does it use primary sources like Lenny Rachitsky?
- Does it take clear positions like Derek Sivers?

If your content has none of these qualities, it will feel AI-generated even if it isn't.

---

## Quick Reference by Vertical

Find examples relevant to your industry:

| Vertical | Examples | Key Patterns |
|----------|----------|--------------|
