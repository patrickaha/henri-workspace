## The Service Business Challenge

Service businesses face unique lead magnet challenges:
1. **Expertise demonstration** — Must prove capability without giving away the farm
2. **Qualification** — Need to identify prospects who can afford and benefit from services
3. **Relationship building** — Services are high-trust purchases
4. **Differentiation** — Many competitors offer similar services

The best service business lead magnets accomplish all four.

## Marketing Agencies

**Types of audits:**
- Website/SEO audit
- Social media audit
- PPC account audit

- Analytics audit

**Why it works:**
- Reveals specific problems (not generic advice)
- Demonstrates expertise through analysis
- Creates natural follow-up conversation
- Prospects see their own data, not hypotheticals

**The structure:**
1. Introduction establishing credibility
2. Current performance analysis with specific findings
3. Competitor comparison (how they stack up)
4. Prioritized recommendations
5. Call to action for deeper engagement

**The bridge:** Free audit reveals problems → Paid services fix those problems

### The ROI Calculator
Help prospects quantify the value of marketing investment.

**Why it works:**

## The Audit Model Deep Dive

The free audit is the workhorse lead magnet for service businesses. Here's how to execute it well:

### Before the audit:
- Qualify prospects (don't audit everyone)
- Set expectations (what they'll receive)
- Collect necessary access/information

### During the audit:
- Use consistent methodology
- Document specific findings
- Prioritize by impact
- Note quick wins AND strategic opportunities

### The audit report:
1. Executive summary (key findings)
2. Detailed analysis (what you found)
3. Benchmark comparison (how they compare)
4. Recommendations (what to do)
5. Next steps (clear CTA)

### After the audit:
- Schedule review call
- Walk through findings
- Discuss implementation options
- Transition to proposal/engagement

**Key insight:** The audit IS the sales conversation. Done well, it naturally leads to "so can you help me fix this?"

## Qualification Through Lead Magnets

Service businesses should use lead magnets to qualify, not just capture.

**Qualification signals:**
- Which lead magnet downloaded (indicates problem type)
- Information provided during signup
- Engagement with follow-up content
- Questions asked during process

**High-intent lead magnets:**
- Free consultation/strategy session
- Detailed audit request
- Specific solution-focused content

**Low-intent lead magnets:**
- General educational content
- Broad industry reports
- Entertainment-focused content

Match follow-up intensity to intent signal—high-intent leads get immediate personal outreach; low-intent leads get automated nurture.

## Implementation Notes

### Time investment by type:
- **Checklists/templates:** Low (create once, distribute forever)
- **Educational content:** Medium (requires expertise, one-time creation)
- **Assessments/quizzes:** Medium (setup, then automated)
- **Free audits:** High (time per lead, but highest quality)
- **Strategy sessions:** Highest (real-time investment per lead)

### Tech requirements:
- **Basic:** Email platform, PDF/design tool
- **Assessments:** Quiz tool (Typeform, ScoreApp)
- **Audits:** Analysis tools, report templates
- **Sessions:** Scheduling tool, video platform

### ROI consideration:
High-touch lead magnets (audits, sessions) cost more per lead but convert at dramatically higher rates. For service businesses with high customer value, the math often favors fewer, higher-quality leads over volume.
