## Common SaaS Lead Magnet Patterns

### Pattern 1: Free Tool (Loss Leader)
Offer a genuinely useful free tool, capture users, upsell.

**Examples:**
- HubSpot Website Grader
- Ahrefs Webmaster Tools
- Canva free design tools

**Key insight:** The free tool should be good enough to use forever AND limited enough that power users want more.

### Pattern 2: ROI Calculator
Help prospects quantify the value of your solution.

**Examples:**
- IBM ROI calculators
- CartHook conversion calculator
- Various SaaS "savings calculators"

**Key insight:** Calculators require prospect to input their data—this self-reported data enables highly personalized follow-up and demonstrates value in their specific context.

### Pattern 3: Freemium Tier
Give away a constrained version of the product forever.

**Examples:**
- Slack free tier
- Dropbox free storage
- Calendly free scheduling

**Key insight:** Freemium works best for products with network effects or those where usage naturally leads to needing more.

### Pattern 4: Assessment/Audit
Analyze something the prospect cares about and deliver personalized insights.

**Examples:**
- Security audits
- Performance benchmarks
- Competitive analysis tools

**Key insight:** Assessments reveal problems your product solves, creating natural "problem → solution" positioning.

### Pattern 5: Templates and Checklists
Provide ready-to-use templates that work with your product.

**Examples:**
- Notion templates
- HubSpot marketing templates
- Zapier pre-built workflows

**Key insight:** Templates lower the barrier to product adoption while demonstrating use cases.

## Key Metrics for SaaS Lead Magnets

1. **Conversion rate** — What % of visitors convert to leads?
2. **Lead-to-MQL rate** — What % become marketing qualified?
3. **MQL-to-customer rate** — What % eventually buy?
4. **CAC by lead source** — What does each lead magnet cost per customer?
5. **Time to conversion** — How long from lead to customer?

The best SaaS lead magnets optimize for quality over quantity—fewer leads that convert is better than many leads that don't.
