# AI Talking Head

Generate talking head videos, presenter content, and lip-synced videos.

**Use this skill when:** You need a person (real or AI) talking to camera.
**Route here from:** ai-creative-workflow, ai-creative-strategist, or direct requests.

---

## Why This Skill Exists

**The problem:** Talking head videos are the most persuasive content format but:
1. Recording yourself is time-consuming and requires confidence
2. Professional presenters are expensive ($500-5000+ per video)
3. UGC creators charge $100-500 per post and may not match your brand
4. Iterating on scripts means re-filming everything
5. Scaling personalized video is nearly impossible manually

**The solution:** AI talking heads that:
- Generate professional presenter videos in minutes
- Let you iterate on scripts without re-recording
- Create unlimited variants for A/B testing
- Maintain consistent brand presenter identity
- Scale personalized outreach cost-effectively

**The game-changer:** Combining avatar generation + lip-sync lets you:
- Create a consistent "brand spokesperson"
- Update any script without re-filming
- Test multiple presenter styles quickly
- Produce video content at 10x the speed

## Presenter Style Exploration (Before Generation)

**Critical insight from ai-creative-strategist:** Don't generate with one style and hope it works. Explore genuinely DIFFERENT presenter styles first.

### The Style Exploration Process

**STEP 1: GENERATE 4-5 DIFFERENT PRESENTER STYLES**

This is NOT: Same person with different clothes
This IS: Fundamentally different presenter archetypes that each tell a different story

```
[YOUR BRAND] - Style Exploration

Generate presenter concepts for these 5 directions:

1. CORPORATE AUTHORITY
   - Demographic: 35-50, professional appearance
   - Setting: Modern office, corporate environment
   - Wardrobe: Business professional, suit/blazer
   - Energy: Confident, measured, authoritative
   - Vibe: "Trust the expert"

2. RELATABLE FRIEND
   - Demographic: 25-40, approachable look
   - Setting: Home office, kitchen, casual space
   - Wardrobe: Smart casual, comfortable
   - Energy: Warm, conversational, genuine
   - Vibe: "Let me share what worked for me"

3. ENERGETIC CREATOR
   - Demographic: 22-35, creator aesthetic
   - Setting: Ring light setup, content studio
   - Wardrobe: Trendy casual, branded
   - Energy: High, dynamic, enthusiastic
   - Vibe: "You HAVE to try this"

4. EXPERT EDUCATOR
   - Demographic: 30-55, credible appearance
   - Setting: Study, library, professional backdrop
   - Wardrobe: Smart casual, glasses optional
   - Energy: Calm, explanatory, helpful
   - Vibe: "Let me explain how this works"

5. LIFESTYLE ASPIRATIONAL
   - Demographic: 28-45, aspirational look
   - Setting: Beautiful home, travel location, luxury
   - Wardrobe: Elevated casual, tasteful
   - Energy: Relaxed confidence, success aura
   - Vibe: "This is what my life looks like"
```

**STEP 2: IDENTIFY WINNER**

After generating style exploration:
```
REVIEW each presenter style:

Which presenter:
- Best matches brand voice?
- Would audience trust most?
- Fits the content type?
- Has right energy level?
- Would work across multiple videos?

WINNER: [Selected style]
BECAUSE: [Why this style wins for this brand/use case]
```

**STEP 3: EXTRACT PRESENTER PRINCIPLES**

Once winner identified:
```
WINNING STYLE EXTRACTION

Demographics:
- Age range: [X-X]
- Gender: [if specific]
- Ethnicity: [if specific]
- Overall look: [descriptors]

Environment:
- Primary setting: [where they present from]

```

**STEP 4: APPLY ACROSS CONTENT**

Use extracted principles for:

- Variations in script, not in presenter

## Video Model Roster (Quality Winners)

Generate presenter videos with ALL THREE models, present outputs for selection:

| Model | Owner | Speed | Strengths |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Sora 2** | openai | ~80s | Excellent general quality, good faces |
| **Veo 3.1** | google | ~130s | Native audio generation, natural movement |
| **Kling v2.5 Turbo Pro** | kwaivgi | ~155s | Best for people/motion, most realistic |

**Strategy:** Run same prompt through all 3 models → User picks best output.

### Model Selection Guide

```
FOR MAXIMUM REALISM (people quality):
    → Kling v2.5 Turbo Pro (best faces, most natural movement)

FOR SPEED + QUALITY BALANCE:
    → Sora 2 (fastest, still good quality)

FOR BUILT-IN AUDIO:
    → Veo 3.1 (generates audio with video)

FOR UGC AUTHENTICITY:
    → Kling v2.5 (handles casual movements well)

FOR CORPORATE/FORMAL:
    → Sora 2 or Kling v2.5 (cleaner, more controlled)
```

---

## Lip-Sync Model

For adding speech to existing videos:

| Model | Use | Cost | Speed | Quality |
|-------|-----|------|-------|---------|
| **Kling Lip-Sync** | Add voiceover to any video | ~$0.20 | ~1min | Excellent |

**When to use Lip-Sync:**
- You have a great presenter video but need different script
- Client wants to change messaging after video generation
- Creating personalized versions of same base video
- Adding voiceover to product demo videos
- Dubbing content for different languages

---

## Use Cases Deep Dive

### 1. Lip-Sync Overlay

**Best for:** Adding voiceover to existing video, dubbing, personalization

**Input Requirements:**
- Video with visible face (front-facing works best)
- Audio file (MP3, WAV) OR text script

**Workflow:**
```json
{
  "model_owner": "kwaivgi",
  "model_name": "kling-lip-sync",
  "Prefer": "wait",
  "input": {
    "video": "https://... (source video URL)",
    "audio": "https://... (audio file URL)"
  }
}
```

**Or with text (uses built-in TTS):**
```json
{
  "input": {
    "video": "https://... (source video URL)",
    "text": "Script text to speak"
  }
}
```

**Quality Tips:**
- Source video should have face visible 70%+ of time
- Forward-facing shots work better than profiles
- Avoid videos with heavy face movement/turning
- Audio should be clear without background noise
- Script pacing should match natural speech

---

### 2. AI Presenter Generation

**Best for:** Creating presenter content from scratch, brand spokesperson

**Multi-Model Workflow:**

```json
// Sora 2
{
  "model_owner": "openai",
  "model_name": "sora-2",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "[presenter prompt]",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "duration": 5
  }
}

// Veo 3.1 (with native audio)
{
  "model_owner": "google",
  "model_name": "veo-3.1",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "[presenter prompt]",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "generate_audio": true
  }
}

// Kling v2.5
{
  "model_owner": "kwaivgi",
  "model_name": "kling-v2.5-turbo-pro",
  "input": {
    "prompt": "[presenter prompt]",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "duration": 5
  }
}
```

**Then add lip-sync if specific script needed:**
```json
{
  "model_owner": "kwaivgi",
  "model_name": "kling-lip-sync",
  "input": {
    "video": "[generated video URL]",
    "text": "[script text]"
  }
}
```

### 3. UGC-Style Content

**Best for:** Authentic testimonials, product reviews, social proof

**The UGC Formula:**
```
[Relatable person] + [Casual setting] + [Natural lighting] +
[Authentic delivery] + [Genuine reaction] = Believable UGC
```

**Prompt Template:**
```
Friendly [demographic] sitting in [casual setting], natural window light,
holding/showing [product], genuine excited expression, talking directly to
camera like filming a selfie video, authentic UGC testimonial style, casual
comfortable body language, 5 seconds
```

**UGC Authenticity Markers:**
- Slightly imperfect framing
- Natural lighting (not studio)
- Casual wardrobe
- Real reactions, not posed
- Personal space as backdrop
- Eye contact with camera

- Same energy level
- Same lighting setup

Only change: Script and specific content
```

**Series Prompt Template:**
```
[Consistent presenter description - use same each time], [same setting],
[same lighting], [same wardrobe style], [same energy], discussing [new topic],
[consistent delivery style], 5 seconds
```

---

## Script Mastery

**Rule:** ~150 words per minute at natural conversational pace

### Script Structures

```

After (10-25 sec): [Transformation/result]
CTA (25-30 sec): [How to get same result]
```

### Tone Templates

**Professional/Corporate:**
```
"[Name] here with [Company]. Today I want to share how [product/insight]
can help you [achieve outcome]. Here's what you need to know..."
```

## Audio & Voice Considerations

### When Using Veo 3.1 Native Audio

**Strengths:**
- Generates synchronized audio with video
- Natural ambient sounds
- Speech that matches lip movement
- Good for establishing scenes

**Limitations:**
- Less control over specific script
- Audio quality varies
- May need post-processing

### When Adding Lip-Sync

**Best Practices:**
- Use high-quality audio recording
- Match energy level to video presenter
- Pace script to natural speaking rhythm
- Allow for breath pauses
- Keep sentences short (easier sync)

### Voice-Over Tips

**If recording your own VO for lip-sync:**
```
□ Record in quiet environment
□ Use consistent distance from mic
□ Match energy to presenter style
□ Natural pauses between sentences
□ Clear enunciation
□ Export as MP3 or WAV
```

**If using TTS (text input):**
```
□ Use punctuation for natural pauses
□ Write phonetically for tricky words
□ Keep sentences conversational length
□ Test different phrasings
□ Consider adding "..." for pauses
```

---

## Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify Requirements

Before generating:
```
□ What's the use case? (UGC, corporate, educational, etc.)
□ What platform? (TikTok, YouTube, LinkedIn, ads)
□ What aspect ratio? (9:16, 16:9, 1:1)
□ What duration? (and word count)
□ What presenter style? (see archetypes)
□ What's the script/message?
□ Need lip-sync to specific audio?
```

### Step 2: Style Selection

If not predefined:
```
□ Generate style exploration with 4-5 different presenter styles
□ Present options to user
□ Extract principles from winner
□ Document for consistency
```

### Step 3: Construct Prompt

Use this formula:
```
[PRESENTER DESCRIPTION] + [SETTING] + [LIGHTING] +
[EXPRESSION/ENERGY] + [ACTION] + [STYLE MODIFIER] + [DURATION]
```

### Step 4: Multi-Model Generation

```
Run same prompt through:
1. Sora 2 (~80s)
2. Veo 3.1 (~130s)
3. Kling v2.5 (~155s)

Present all three to user for selection.
```

### Step 5: Add Lip-Sync (If Needed)

If specific script delivery required:
```
1. User approves video from Step 4
2. Run through Kling Lip-Sync
3. Input: selected video + audio/text
4. Output: synced talking head
```

### Step 6: Deliver & Iterate

```markdown
## Talking Head Video Options

## Tips from Experience

### What Works

1. **Consistency beats variety** — Same presenter across videos builds recognition
2. **Kling v2.5 for faces** — Most realistic human generation
3. **Shorter is safer** — 5-10 second clips avoid quality degradation
4. **Explicit energy levels** — "calm and measured" vs "enthusiastic and dynamic"
5. **Multi-model approach** — Always generate with 2-3 models, let user pick
6. **Lip-sync extends value** — One good video can become many scripts

### What Doesn't Work

1. **Vague presenter description** — "A person talking" = generic results
2. **Long continuous takes** — Quality degrades after 10-15 seconds
3. **Ignoring setting** — Presenter without context looks artificial
4. **Skipping style exploration** — First idea rarely best for brand
5. **Mismatched energy** — Corporate script + UGC style = awkward
6. **Complex movements** — Walking + talking + gesturing = artifacts

### The 80/20

80% of talking head success comes from:
1. Clear presenter archetype selection
2. Matching energy to platform
3. Short, punchy scripts
4. Using Kling v2.5 for realism

Get these four right, and you'll get good results.
