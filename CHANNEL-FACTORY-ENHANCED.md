# Enhanced Channel Factory Flow

## The Henri Way™

### Opening

When someone says "new channel" or "create channel":

```

Ah! A new workspace. The decisive moment.

Let's architect this properly. Four quick questions and we'll have your channel running.
```

### Question 1: Channel Name

```
📝 *Channel name?*
Think lowercase, underscores for spaces. Like a good variable name.

Examples:
• instagram_audit
• weekly_reports
• pseo_content

What's yours?
```

### Question 2: Privacy

```
🔐 *Public or private?*

*Public* = Team can discover and join
*Private* = Invite-only, for sensitive work

Most channels are public. Private for client work or pre-launch projects.
```

### Question 3: Purpose (with personality)

```
🎯 *One sentence - what's this channel for?*

Not a mission statement. Just tell me what happens here.

Good: "Instagram audit system development"
Bad: "A collaborative workspace for synergistic Instagram optimization"

Keep it sharp.
```

### Question 4: Skills (visual menu)

```
🛠️ *Pick your tools:*

*Core Skills* (recommended for most channels)
☑️ **vault** - Read/write Obsidian docs
☑️ **canvas** - Create/edit Slack canvases  
☑️ **tasks** - Track TODOs
☑️ **search** - Search knowledge base

*Extra Powers*
☐ **zoom** - Webinar analytics
☐ **calendar** - Google Calendar
☐ **web** - Fetch external sites
☐ **imagen** - Generate images
☐ **ga4** - Google Analytics
☐ **gsc** - Search Console
☐ **code** - GitHub integration

Reply with skills to add/remove, or just say "defaults" ✨
```

### Confirmation

### Welcome Message (in new channel)

```
[GIF: welcome]

Welcome to #instagram_audit! 🎉

*Here's how to drive this thing:*

**Add tasks:** Just tell me what needs doing
**Check progress:** Look at the TODO canvas (pinned)
**See the plan:** README canvas has the overview
**What I can do:** code, vault, canvas, tasks, search

*Quick start:*
Try "Add task: Review current Instagram scraper code"

Ready when you are!
```

## Error Handling

### Name collision
```
Hmm. #instagram_audit already exists.

Try:
• instagram_audit_v2
• ig_audit_system
• insta_audits

What works?
```

### Invalid characters
```
[GIF: nope]

Channel names need to be lowercase, underscores only.

"Instagram-Audit-2024" → "instagram_audit_2024"
"IG Audits!" → "ig_audits"

Try again?
```

## The Vibe

- Quick and confident
- No over-explaining  
- Visual feedback (GIFs at key moments)
- Clear examples > abstract rules
- Celebrate the creation
- Get them using it immediately

## Key Improvements

1. **Personality throughout** - Not a form, a conversation
2. **Visual elements** - GIFs for engagement, emojis for scanning
3. **Examples first** - Show good patterns before rules
4. **Immediate value** - Drop them in channel with starter task
5. **Error prevention** - Show valid examples upfront
6. **Celebration moment** - Make channel creation feel special

This flow turns channel creation from bureaucracy into a moment of possibility.
